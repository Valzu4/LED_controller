# Led controller
This project is a LED strip controller that can be controlled remotely. This was customed to the needs of my frend, and the boards include different input and output capabilities designed to accompany those needs.

The project was designed around a ESP32 module. More spesific information can be found under `/doc` folder in a PDF form or altium design files.
